    "text": "Design and Testing Methodology\nSince this is functionally the same as what was done in lab 1 – controlling a display with a 4-bit input/switch – the seven_segment module from lab 1 could be reused, as long as the inputs rapidly switch according to the mux’s enable signal. Utilizing the same on-board high-speed oscillator (HSOSC) module that was used in lab 1, the clock signal was divided in order to drive the rate at which power is switched between displays. Using a 25-bit clock that is driven by the HSOSC’s clock signal, the mux module focuses on a specific bit of the clock in order to control the output of the mux, and the value of the enable signals, enable[0] and enable[1]. In this case, it was experimentally determined that the 18th bit of the counter, counter[18], allowed for the displays to appear static without any bleeding. Using two 2N3906 PNP transistors, the current could be selectively sent to one display at a time. Using GPIO pins, enable[0] and enable[1] were each sent to the base of an individual transistor, with the collector of the transistors each being routed to the power pins of one of the displays (more clearly shown in Figure 2).\nDepending on the value of counter[18], the mux within the mux module will output a 4-bit value, s, which will be equal to either s1 or s2 (which are 4-bit values controlled by independent switches), while the mux module updates the value of enable[0] and enable[1]. These changes are dictated by enable[0] = counter[18], enable[1] = ~counter[18], and s = counter[18] ? s1 : s2. In the top module, lab2_jc, the clock is generated using the HSOSC module then fed into the mux. The output, s, of the instantiated mux module is then fed into the seven_segment module that then decodes the value of s into its corresponding segments. These are then via GPIO to the display itself. The top module is also responsible for handling the sum of the two inputs, s1 and s2, which it then assigns to led[4:0]. It is important to note that the values of s1 and s2 control display 0 and 1, respectively."

The modules were able to compile successfully, but after a closer look, it was apparent that our approaches were slightly different, but I wasn’t entirely disappointed by the result. There are differences in syntax and the use of generate statements that I am not entirely familiar with, but the logic seems fine to me. It seems that they chose to utilize the positive and negative edges of the clock for the time-multiplexing, which is another apporoach I was thinking of when I began to develop my modules."

Truth table relating switch inputs to LEDs and seven segment display.\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, a 4-input switch will control both the seven segment display and 2 separate LEDs. The seven segment display consists of 7 LEDs that each correspond to a segment. Since the display is a common anode display, each segment will be activated when the GPIO pin that it is connected to is pulled to 0V, meaning that a value of 0 will indicate that a segment is ON. All the diodes’ anodes will be connected to 3.3V that comes directly from the UPduino, while the cathode will be connected to a GPIO pin and a current-limiting resistor. Combinational logic was used to drive LEDs 0 and 1, where led[0] = s[0] ^ s[1] and led[1] = s[2] & s[3], while LED 2 was set to constantly blink at a frequency of 2.4 Hz. This was done through the use of the built-in HSOSC (high speed oscillator) that was set to 48 MHz then divided to match the correct blinking frequency.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Calculation of how many cycles will produce a correct blinking frequency of 2.4 Hz.\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 2, calculations were performed to determine how many cycles our counter would need to count to before turning off and then back on. It was determined that for 10,000,000 cycles our LED would have to be off and then on for another 10,000,000 cycles.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Calculation of resistors to safely operate LEDs in the seven segment display.\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, it was important to have resistors that limit the amount of current passing through our LEDs, so the appropriate resistance was calculated using the typical operating current and forward voltage (as shown in Figure 3). It is important to note that these calculations were made using an input voltage of 5V, instead of the required 3.3V, since there were difficulties getting adequate voltage out of the UPduino’s 3.3V pin. As shown in the top half of the Figure, it is recommended to use a resistor valued at 122 ohms or greater. Given that 1000 ohm resistors were used, the actual calculations would follow the bottom half of Figure 3."

    "text": "AI Prototype Summary\n\n\n\nAI Response\n\n\nComparing this with my own module that controls the blinking of LED 2, it is immediately clear that the syntax and structure that the LLM utilizes is not easy to read. After attempting to synthesize, the design failed immediately. The AI was unable to successfully instantiate the HSOSC module that is utilized to generate the clock. Feeding the LLM the error message, it suggested that I reorder the inputs to the HSOSC module that it attempted to instantiate. Again, this didn’t work as it should be something like: HSOSC hf_osc (.CLKHFPU(1'b1), .CLKHFEN(1'b1), .CLKHF(clk));. You would imagine that an LLM would be able to catch this simple of an issue, but it struggles. A majority of the code that the LLM produced is hard to read and/or wrong. There is also the use of language that I do not totally understand, since I am still somewhat new to Verilog. This leads me to believe there is some form of overcompensation and the LLM is making it unnecessarily complicated, since this isn’t exactly a complicated module to write. It’s shocking that the LLM is performing so terribly, but this may be due to the data that it is trained on."

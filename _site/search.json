    "text": "Design and Testing Methodology\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Truth table relating switch inputs to LEDs and seven segment display.\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, a 4-input switch will control both the seven segment display and 2 separate LEDs. The seven segment display consists of 7 LEDs that each correspond to a segment. Since the display is a common anode display, each segment will be activated when the GPIO pin that it is connected to is pulled to 0V, meaning that a value of 0 will indicate that a segment is ON. All the diodes’ anodes will be connected to 3.3V that comes directly from the UPduino, while the cathode will be connected to a GPIO pin and a current-limiting resistor. Combinational logic was used to drive LEDs 0 and 1, where led[0] = s[0] ^ s[1] and led[1] = s[2] & s[3], while LED 2 was set to constantly blink at a frequency of 2.4 Hz. This was done through the use of the HSOSC (high speed oscillator) built into the iCE40UP library that was then divided to match the correct frequency.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Calculation of how many cycles will produce a correct blinking frequency of 2.4 Hz.\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 2, calculations were performed to determine how many cycles our counter would need to count to before turning off and then back on. It was determined that for 10,000,000 cycles our LED would have to be off and then on for another 10,000,000 cycles.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Calculation of resistors to safely operate LEDs in the seven segment display.\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, it was important to have resistors that limit the amount of current passing through our LEDs, so the appropriate resistance was calculated using the typical operating current and forward voltage (as shown in Figure 3). It is important to note that these calculations were made using an input voltage of 5V, instead of the required 3.3V, since there were difficulties getting adequate voltage out of the UPduino’s 3.3V pin. As shown in the top half of the Figure, it is recommended to use a resistor valued at 122 ohms or greater. Given that 1000 ohm resistors were used, the actual calculations would follow the bottom half of Figure 3. ## Technical Documentation:\n\nBlock Diagram\n\n\n\nThis is a placeholder.\n\n\n\n\nSchematic\n\n\n\nThis is a placeholder."
